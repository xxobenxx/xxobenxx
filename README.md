### Hello this is Obi, 👋

I am a passionate Jr. Full-Stack Web Developer with a diverse background in business and video/music production, currently living in Barcelona/Spain. <br>
          Armed with a Bachelor of Sciences degree in physics and a MBA, I immersed myself in the world of business and video/music production before 
          finding my true calling in coding. My exploration of past roles allowed me to seamlessly blend creativity with technology, setting 
          the stage for my transition to coding through a rigorous JavaScript Full-Stack Bootcamp.<br><br>

I speak
